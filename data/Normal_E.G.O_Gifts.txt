These are all of the Non-Fusion E.G.O Gifts, sorted based on their Sin Affinity.
Feel free to Ctrl-F to find the E.G.O Gift you want!
Note: The Abnormality Names listed on these E.G.O Gifts are translations of datamined image files, and thus might be changed when an official name is given to them.
Here is the format for each EGO Gift:
Tier -> The Tier of the Gift
Sin -> The Sin Affinity of the Gift
Type -> A TLDR for the Gift
Keyword -> The Keyword associated in game with the Gift.
Base Cost -> The base cost to buy/sell this gift before modifiers.
Abno Events -> Any Abnormalities or Abnormality Events (the ? mark nodes) associated with the Gift.
Floor Theme Packs -> If it says Mirror Dungeon _, then it came out with that Mirror Dungeon and will be in those associated packs in MD5. If it has a specific name, such as 'The Unchanging' it is ONLY found in that specific Floor Theme Pack. For a more detailed explanation, see my Mirror (Dungeon) of the Wuthering Cheat Sheet.
